At the time of writing, I lead communities with a total of over 16 million members! Most of this community management is done on Reddit, where I keep subreddits running smoothly.
This has taught me how to configure automoderator through coding and I have learned a little bit about regular expressions. I've also learned how to respond politely/efficiently to members who request help and resolve conflicts that arise.

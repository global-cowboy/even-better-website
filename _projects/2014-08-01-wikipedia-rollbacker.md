### What is a Rollbacker on Wikipedia?

On December 17, 2023, a Wikipedia Administrator granted rollback permissions to my account so I can quickly revert vandalism and disruptive edits. I have an extra button when viewing the history of edits on pages that lets me roll back edits. This has taught me to use Huggle, a tool developed for combatting vandalism on Wikipedia. I've become quite fast in catching malicious edits.

Since a young age, I have been interested in computers and how they work. This has helped me become familiar with Windows and Linux ecosystems as well as basic helpdesk/troubleshooting techniques.

## Important things I've learned:
Take notes. Take a lot of notes.\
It never hurts to have too many notes and documentation related to the things you fix. You never know if the same problem is going to come up a second time.

Google, Youtube, Reddit and ChatGPT are all excellent sources of information and should be checked when you cannot find the answers elsewhere. It is not embarassing to Google things.

Big tech does not have the end user's best interest in mind. ðŸ˜‚

Turn it off and on, even if your colleague or the end user has already rebooted it multiple times.

Another project of mine is community management. At the time of writing, I lead multiple Reddit communities with a total of over 20 million members and a Discord server with 10 thousand members! Most of this work is done on Reddit, where I keep subreddits running smoothly. This has taught me how to configure automoderator through coding and I have learned a little bit about regular expressions. I've also learned how to respond politely/efficiently to members who request help and resolve conflicts that arise.

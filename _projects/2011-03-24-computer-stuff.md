I've become familiar with Windows and Linux ecosystems and basic helpdesk/troubleshooting techniques.

## Important things I've learned:
Take notes. Take a lot of notes.\
It never hurts to have too many notes and documentation related to the things you fix. You never know if the same problem is going to come up a second time.

Google, Youtube, Reddit and ChatGPT are all excellent sources of information and should be checked when you cannot find the answers elsewhere.

Big tech does not have the end user's best interest in mind. ðŸ˜‚

Turn it off and on, even if your colleague or the end user has already rebooted it multiple times.
